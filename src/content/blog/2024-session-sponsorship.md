description: Directions for obtaining DGSG Session sponsorship.

This is just a quick note about session sponsorship, which is one of the more arcane components of AAG session organizing that takes new organizers by surprise, so I thought I'd reach out to clarify how the DGSG approaches it.

Basically, when you submit a session, you have the opportunity to identify the DGSG (and other specialty groups) as a session sponsor. This sounds like a longer process than it is---if your session is aligned with the goals of the DGSG and scholarship in digital geography, please feel fully empowered to reach out to me ([ehuntley@mit.edu](mailto:ehuntley@mit.edu)) and Ryan Burns, vice chair ([ryan.burns1@ucalgary.ca](mailto:ryan.burns1@ucalgary.ca)) with a summary of your session and we'll be happy to review it for sponsorship. Note also that we take a broad view of digital geographies, and see many critical questions of media, governance, data science, mapping practice, games, and the digital as fully within the remit of our subdiscipline.
