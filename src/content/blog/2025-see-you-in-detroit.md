description: Directions for obtaining DGSG Session sponsorship.

The Digital Geographies Specialty Group is looking forward to seeing you in Detroit, Michigan this coming March 24--26. (On a personal note, I'm particularly excited to see geographers returning to my beloved Rust Belt.)

We'll be announcing more events and activities soon, but for now a quick note about __session sponsorship__. This sometimes takes new organizers by surprise, so I thought I'd clarify how the DGSG approaches it.

Basically session sponsorship flags your session as being "of interest" to a particular specialty group. It involves getting the _imprimatur_ of that specialty group's leadership This sounds like a more involved process than it is---if your session is aligned with the goals of the DGSG and scholarship in digital geography, please feel fully empowered to reach out to me ([ehuntley@mit.edu](mailto:ehuntley@mit.edu)) and Ryan Burns, vice chair ([ryan.burns1@ucalgary.ca](mailto:ryan.burns1@ucalgary.ca)) with a summary of your session and we'll be happy to review it for sponsorship. 

The DGSG takes a broad view of digital geographies! We see many critical questions of media, governance, data science, mapping practice, games, and the digital as fully within the remit of our subdiscipline and hope that you'll take this opportunity to bring your work into conversation with ours.
