We are running elections for the DGSG Board this year! Specifically, we are seeking two student representatives to serve one-year terms. If you're interested (or want to nominate someone), please fill out this nomination form.

The call for nominees will be open until March 15, at which point Emily Barrett and Michael McCanless (our current student representatives) will call the election, which will close in the week before the AAG's annual meeting.
