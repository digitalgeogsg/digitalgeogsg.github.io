The Digital Geographies Specialty Group (DGSG) invites submissions for the following research and paper awards, which will be presented at the DGSG Business Meeting at the 2024 Annual Meeting of the AAG, April 16--20 in Honolulu (with a hybrid option for those attending from elsewhere).

## Awards

Up to __one $250 award__ will be presented to an __outstanding doctoral dissertation__.

Up to __one $200 award__ will be presented to an __outstanding student paper__ (graduate or undergraduate) being presented at the 2024 AAG Annual Meeting either in person or virtually.

Up to __one $200 award__ will be presented to the builder(s) of an outstanding __software tool, platform, or interactive map/visualization__ that is aligned with digital geographies.

Up to __two $200 research awards__ will be presented to support current or prospective research focusing on __racial justice (broadly construed) and digital geographies__. We are particularly interested in supporting work that examines how digital technologies are intertwined with the spatial dimensions of racialized systems of domination across various geographic scales and global contexts and how these technologies can support the work of liberation, equity, and justice.

The awards will be presented to the authors of the best submission(s), as determined by a review panel composed of members of the DGSG board.

## Eligibility

Our understanding of what falls within digital geography is intentionally broad. We encourage critical submissions addressing, for example, AI, automation, smart technologies, digital ethnographies, GIS and mapping, data infrastructures, counterdata, citizen science, feminist epistemologies, data sovereignty, spatial media, the sharing or gig economy, and the politics of digitalization and technification. _This list, however, is meant to be illustrative, not exhaustive._

The __paper awards__ are limited to current graduate and undergraduate students who are the first (or sole) author of the submitted paper and are presenting at the 2024 Annual Meeting (in an in-person or virtual format). The competition is open to both published and unpublished papers. Undergraduate submissions should be 3,000-4,000 words, and graduate submissions should be 5,000-8,000 words (including e.g., bibliography, notes, figure captions).

The __software tool, platform, or interactive map/visualization award__ is limited to early career and independent scholars (graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, non-tenured faculty, adjunct faculty, independent researchers). Eligible submissions must be for a tool that is publicly available and operational. _Applicants need not be registered for the 2024 AAG meeting._

The __dissertation award__ is limited to early career and independent scholars (graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, non-tenured faculty, adjunct faculty, independent researchers). To qualify, the dissertation should have been defended and filed at their respective academic institutions within the last two years. _Applicants need not be registered for the 2024 AAG meeting._

The __racial justice research awards__ are limited to early career and independent scholars (graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, non-tenured faculty, adjunct faculty, independent researchers). _Applicants need not be registered for the 2024 AAG meeting._

## Deadlines

Submissions should be received by __Monday, March 25, 2023 by 11:59 PM US Eastern time__.

Winners will be notified in early April, announced at the DGSG Business Meeting at the 2024 AAG meeting in Honolulu, and shared with the group email list after the meeting.

+ For __software tool, platform, or interactive map/visualization awards__, a 200-300 word description of the problem the project was trying to address and what makes the tool well-suited for this award. Applicants are encouraged to submit e.g., GitHub repositories as well.
